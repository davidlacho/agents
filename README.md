## Overview

This project integrates AI and database management through a sophisticated Python setup, enabling interaction with a SQLite database. The core functionality revolves around querying the database, generating reports, and handling chat models with callbacks for dynamic interaction. This system uses `langchain` for AI-based chat interactions, `dotenv` for environment management, and custom tools for database inspection and report generation.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Chat Interface**: Utilizes `langchain` to power AI-driven conversations, enabling natural language queries about database content.
- **Dynamic Database Interaction**: Integrates with SQLite databases, allowing for dynamic queries and table introspection without prior knowledge of the database schema.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Includes tools for generating HTML reports based on query results, facilitating easy dissemination of insights.
- **Modular Design**: Features a modular design with custom handlers and tools, making it adaptable to different databases and use cases.

## How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**: Begins with loading environment variables using `dotenv`, setting up the necessary configuration for database connection and AI functionality.

2. **Chat Model Initialization**: Initializes the chat model with `ChatOpenAI` from `langchain`, incorporating custom callbacks for enhanced interactivity.

3. **Database Inspection**: Utilizes `list_tables` and `describe_tables` to introspect the database schema, allowing the AI to understand the available tables and structure.

4. **Query Execution**: Executes database queries using natural language inputs, with support for complex queries and interactions through the AI interface.

5. **Report Generation**: Generates HTML reports based on query results, using a custom report writing tool for presentation and analysis.

6. **Conversation and Memory Management**: Manages conversation history and context using `ConversationBufferMemory`, ensuring continuity and relevance in interactions.
